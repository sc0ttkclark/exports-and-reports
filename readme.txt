Define custom exports / reports for users, based off of any custom MySQL SELECT query you define.

== Description ==

Define custom exports / reports for users, based off of any MySQL SELECT query you create. This plugin interacts with your SELECT query and does all the hard work for you: exporting, pagination, ordering, searching/filtering, and display formatting for you.

All you do is install the plugin, create your Groups, create your Reports, and hand it off to your clients. Exportable reports in CSV, TSV, XML, JSON, and custom delimiter separated formats.

Please submit bug reports or contribute your own enhancements/fixes on [GitHub](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark/exports-and-reports).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What are Groups?**

Groups are groupings of Reports that are given their own menu item in the "Reports" menu.

**What is a Report?**

A Report is defined by a Custom MySQL query and can be configured to display however you wish using additional field definitions. Exports can be disabled per report.

**My report isn't working**

As an admin, add &debug=1 to the end of the report URL to see the query that this plugin uses, take that query and use it in your own MySQL client or PHPMyAdmin to see if there are any errors in your own query.
